# Crowdin PHP client

The Crowdin PHP client is a lightweight interface to the Crowdin API v2. It provides common services for making API requests.

Our API is a full-featured RESTful API that helps you to integrate localization into your development process. The endpoints that we use allow you to easily make calls to retrieve information and to execute actions needed.

For more about Crowdin API see the [documentation](https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/api/).
